description: 'The [stereo_image_proc](https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/tree/humble/stereo_image_proc)
  package computes the disparity map using a left and right image. A disparity map
  represents the difference in pixel position between corresponding points in the
  stereo images. Disparity images are images that show the difference in displacement
  or distance between corresponding points in a pair of stereo images. Stereo images
  are two images of the same scene taken from slightly different viewpoints, such
  as from the left and right eyes of a human observer or from two cameras. Disparity
  images are often used in computer vision and image processing applications, such
  as 3D reconstruction, depth estimation, and object recognition. By analyzing the
  disparities between corresponding points in stereo images, it is possible to infer
  the depth of objects in the scene and create a 3D representation of the environment. '
